</div>
<p>Code review is a software quality assurance activity during
which a program is evaluate against a standardized list of
expectations. During the evaluation, the program is carefully
inspected for bugs that the original developer overlooked.
Without standards to uphold, code reviewers will miss defects
due to improper code review techniques.</p>
<p>This chapter begins with a thorough description of code review
and its benefits; then, it discusses how to initiate a code
review followed by an extensive walk-through on how to perform a
code review from start to finish.</p>
<div class="section" id="modern-code-review">
<h2>Modern Code Review<a class="headerlink" href="#modern-code-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past, the author of a code change would sit down
with reviewers to go through the code and find defects. However,
it was found that code reviews with meetings consumed significantly
more time and money than code reviews without meetings without
providing a significant increase in defect detection
<a class="reference internal" href="#johnson-tjahjono" id="id1"><span>[Johnson-Tjahjono]</span></a>. As a solution, code reviewers began to employ
tools to make the process asynchronous, which means the reviewer
can inspect code at any time. Through the use of source control
tools, code writers began to make small, relevant changes
rather than large, intricate changes. This approach came to
be known as <em>modern code review</em>.</p>
<p>Both open-source and industry software projects utilize modern code
review <a class="reference internal" href="#sadowski-soderberg-bacchelli" id="id2"><span>[Sadowski-Soderberg-Bacchelli]</span></a>—and for good reasons: the
reported benefits from reviewing code are abundant. While code reviews
require a large time investment, an impressive return on investment has
been shown. For instance, at Hewlett-Packard, code review was found to
reduce the time for an application to get to market by 1.8 months
<a class="reference internal" href="#grady-van-slack" id="id3"><span>[Grady-Van-Slack]</span></a>. It was further shown that code review has many positive
side effects. Researchers at Microsoft have found that code review
acts as a transfer of knowledge between the code reviewer and reviewee,
increases team participation, and helps provide a productive way of
finding alternative solutions to problems <a class="reference internal" href="#bacchelli-bird" id="id4"><span>[Bacchelli-Bird]</span></a>. The magnitude
of these benefits greatly depends on the skill-level of the code reviewers
involved. Therefore, it is critical to choose highly experienced reviewers
when submitting code for inspection.</p>
<p>Locating overlooked defects is the main motive for reviewing code submitted
for inspection. These defects are generally split into two categories:
<em>functionality</em> and <em>evolvability defects</em>. When discussing <em>functionality
defects</em> during an inspection, the code reviewer is typically indicating
that a code of code has logical issues. On the other hand, <em>evolvability
defects</em> describe issues with the organization of code or the contents of
documentation <a class="reference internal" href="#mantyla-lassenius" id="id5"><span>[Mantyla-Lassenius]</span></a>. Of the two kinds of defects, evolvability
defects are the most damaging to a project over the course of the development
life cycle. This is due to the large time investment required in order to
rewrite a piece of software that has matured around evolvability defects.
Unfortunately, they also happen to be the most common; therefore, most of
efforts of code review are spent locating these kinds of bugs.</p>

<div class="section" id="making-nano-commits">
<h3>Making Nano-Commits<a class="headerlink" href="#making-nano-commits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Nano-committing</em> is the act of submitting code for review in small,
homogenous portions. In other words, the code is meant to complete
a sub-task of the overarching feature being implemented. During the
development process, making nano-commits can you help keep track of
the work-flow. For instance, if a bug is found, then you can sift
through the small changes until the bug either disappears or changes.
This will help you make the necessary changes at the root, keeping
the fix clean.</p>
<p>Some tasks you may consider keeping as separate commits are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Refracting code before making changes to its logic;</p></li>
<li><p>Adding or modifying documentation;</p></li>
<li><p>Fixing a bug or creating a small feature;</p></li>
<li><p>Or changing configuration settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you, as the developer, are responsible for
making code as smooth to review as possible. Nano-commits can
aid the code reviewer to follow your work-flow easily. Furthermore,
while smaller commit sizes greatly reduce the likelihood of
creating bugs <a class="reference internal" href="#purushothaman-perry" id="id6"><span>[Purushothaman-Perry]</span></a>, they still pose a risk
and should be reviewed for correctness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ensuring-your-code-is-complete">
<h3>Ensuring Your Code Is Complete<a class="headerlink" href="#ensuring-your-code-is-complete" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before committing your code, it is wise to do a <em>personal code review</em>
to locate as many issues as you can before passing it along to another
person. In doing so, you will avoid potentially wasting time on several
more iterations of code review than necessary <a class="reference internal" href="#humphrey" id="id7"><span>[Humphrey]</span></a>. While you
perform the personal code review, you should keep a checklist of
common mistakes to look for. By utilizing a checklist, you will
ensure both efficiency and consistency from your personal code reviews.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to be courteous of your code reviewer’s
time.  Your code should be ready for customers and void of any obvious
bugs. Ideally, the code reviewer should only have to make comments
regarding the implementation and not about major issues that need fixed.
A study from Microsoft found that only around 15% of comments
during code review address bugs <a class="reference internal" href="#czerwonka-greiler-tilford" id="id8"><span>[Czerwonka-Greiler-Tilford]</span></a>, which
indicates a greater emphasis on other areas, such as code styling or
long-term maintainability. It is also important to keep the responsibilities
of the code review in mind: it is not their job to fix your bugs; their
purpose is to notice and bring small, easy-to-miss issues to your attention
for you to go back and fix. If you submit incomplete code with known
issues, then you waste both your and your code reviewer’s time. In
order to collaborate as a team and achieve results, it is important to
remain considerate of your collaborators efforts <a class="reference internal" href="#dreu-weingart" id="id9"><span>[Dreu-Weingart]</span></a>.</p>
<p>A change that causes external features to fail is a less obvious
sign of incomplete code. With an extensive system of unit tests,
these issues are more obvious by validating that a change does not
damage older features. With this in mind, it is vital to implement
unit tests alongside new features. Implementation of unit tests
guarantees protection from hidden bugs. In a similar vein, failure
to compile is another sign of a project containing incomplete code.
The error output of the compiler will normally indicate where the
issue is located, so it is vital to read and understand what it says.
It is crucial to verify that none of the unit tests fail and the
build successfully compiles <em>before</em> submitting the change for
a code review.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-to-review">
<h2>What to Review<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For experts, knowing what to review is almost second nature. However, for
those just learning how to review code, it is crucial to have a checklist
of standards. While reviewing code, you should refer to the checklist and
ensure that every criteria has been met. In doing so, you will avoid missing
vital steps that may catch many defects.</p>
<p>It is important to note that extreme caution must be used while relying
entirely on the checklist during code reviews. Unfortunately, here are too
many possible kinds of defects, making it impossible to cover all
of them within a checklist; therefore, as a reviewer, you must develop an ability
to detect unique defects on the fly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a checklist is helpful for learning, so please use the following
sections as guidance while reviewing code.</p>
<div class="section" id="code-formatting-and-styling">
<h3>Code Formatting and Styling<a class="headerlink" href="#code-formatting-and-styling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a reviewer, it is vital to ensure the submitted code meets the project’s
code formatting standards. It can take a long time to manually check every
standard, so utilizing automatic formatting tools helps boost
the efficiency of a code review. Oftentimes, these tools come equipped with
the ability to verify that the input files pass all the standards. For instance,
if your codebase is written in Python and you are looking to follow the <em>pep8</em>
standards, then you can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user autopep8
$ find . -iname *.py -exec autopep8 --verbose --aggressive --aggressive -diff {}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above commands first install <em>autopep8</em> to the your user Python
install directory. This will allow you to use the auto formatter on any Python
project you write or review. Then, the command is recursively executed on every
Python file within the current directory and all of its subdirectories. The use
of the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--diff</span></code> flag only prints the fixed violations to the console, leaving
the files unchanged. If you want to change the contents of the file, use <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--in-line</span></code>
instead of <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--diff</span></code>. See <a class="reference internal" href="#autoformatter"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 32</span></a> for a before and after comparison
of one file that has been changed with <em>autopep8</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id12">
<span id="autoformatter"></span><img alt="../_images/autoformatter.png" src="../_images/autoformatter.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 32 </span><span class="caption-text">Before (left) and after (right) using the <em>autopep8</em> auto-formatter. Notice
how the code is much easier to read after it has been formatted properly.
For code to be readable, it is vital for it to be properly formatted. Example
code is from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/">https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/</a>.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>While tools that automate the process are extremely helpful, they do not
catch every formatting issue. After applying the auto-formatter, you must
double-check each file under review ensure the auto-formatter did not miss
any important standards and did not raise a false-positive. In the case of
the latter issue, auto-formatter tools often come equipped with the ability
to suppress the false-positive. Refer to the documentation of the auto-
formatter you are using for how to do this.</p>
<p>There are also some standards that automated tools cannot detect. These tend
to rely on human choice, such as proper method and variable names. For
instance, take the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/python3</span>
<span class="c1"># badnaming.py</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">printadd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x2</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;=&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="n">printadd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should notice two things that are wrong with this code. First, the method’s
name misleads the user from its actual function. A good method name should
describe exactly what its action is. Second, the names of the function’s
parameters are vague. While they are not incorrect, for the sake of readability,
it is advised to give a clear meaning behind their values. As a code reviewer,
you will want to point out that the name choices used here are unclear, and
advise the code reviewee to change the names. When they resubmit the code for
review, you should see similar code to below.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/python3</span>
<span class="c1"># goodnaming.py</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">printdivide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dividend</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">divisor</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dividend</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">divisor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;=&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dividend</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">divisor</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="n">printdivide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another common mistake to keep an eye out for are <em>magic numbers</em>, or constants
that are hard-coded into an algorithm. The following code demonstrates an important
instance where this error occurs.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/python3</span>

<p>Magic numbers should be replaced by either stand alone constants or an enumeration of
constant values. In this instance, it is more appropriate to use enumeration
to declare the months as constants. Even though the order of months is common knowledge,
it helps preserve the readability of code to declare the numerical values
of the months as an appropriately labeled constant. In python, to obtain the
library for enumeration, you must do</p>

<p>By default, the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logging</span></code> library only logs messages with severity
level of <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code> and above, so <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> are
not included unless the basic configuration is changed. This is makes
it easy to differentiate between information you do and do not want written
to log files in the production build of an application. At the minimum, debugging
information should <em>not</em> be written to log files in the production code.</p>
<p>When reviewing code formatting, it is important to know your team’s standards.
Without this knowledge, it is nearly impossible to locate the defects in
the submitted source code. Using tools for automatic formatting is crucial for
boosting code review efficiency, but they will not catch errors related to naming
conventions and code organization.</p>

<h3>Comment Formatting and Styling<a class="headerlink" href="#comment-formatting-and-styling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For someone well-versed in programming language syntax, reading code should be as
easy as reading a book. However, when details are obfuscated due to multiple levels
of abstraction, even experts can find it difficult to discern the purpose of
a block of code, especially if the original developer is no longer in contact
with the project. But what if there were a trail of clues that helped you traverse
the maze of logic?</p>
<p>Comments play an integral part in the documentation of modern frameworks. As such,
they should be treated carefully during the code review process. One bad comment
can cause a world of problems months or years down the line. As the code reviewer, it
is your job to ensure blatant documentation defects are caught early and before they
cause any major issues.</p>
<p>The first comments to check for are the documentation of all methods, classes, and modules,
ensuring they properly explain the input parameter(s), return value(s), and what happens in between.
In Python, documentation strings (docstrings) link documentation frameworks with methods, classes,
and modules. There are several ways to format docstrings depending on the kind of automatic
documentation framework being used. Regardless of the tool used, ensure that the comments conform
to the required format required by the automatic documentation framework. One popular format is
reStructuredText (reST), which uses Sphinx to generate the documentation. This is the same tool
used to generate this book. The following example demonstrates how reST can be utilized.</p>

<p>While documenting method bodies, it is import to ensure it is completely accurate and comprehensive.
This is where the interesting logic occurs, which can often be complicated and difficult to read.
Therefore, providing step-by-step comments alongside the code can help an unfamiliar reader
understand the program more easily. As a code reviewer, make sure you are able to completely understand
the logic and provide suggestions on what to clarify when you fail to understand a part of the code.
During this process, it is crucial to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has never seen
the code before. The reason being is that newly hired developers will not have nearly the same level
of experience a veteran reviewer (such as yourself), so it is important to keep thieir perspective
in mind.</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, a block of code should have docstrings (or a comparable equivalent depending
on the langauge) and inline comments. When these are missing you must request changes from the
author of the code. Below you will find an example of what a well-documented body of code looks like.</p>

<p>The code above has comments that even a beginner programmer could understand. All
of the important steps in the algorithm are described and the overarching goal
of the algorithm is made clear. While this is the desired goal of comments, it will
not always be the case that new programmers can understand it. Sometimes, there are
programming concepts and strategies that only understood due to experience. In these
cases, do your best to make the code as easy to understand as possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of every comment is to describe the code’s meaning
in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, redundant comments must be avoided as
well, as they may make the code unclear or confusing. Furthermore, commented out code
should also be removed, especially when the code is for debugging purposes. When
reviewing code, keep an eye out for ineffective comments. The block of code below
shows an example of such comments.</p>
